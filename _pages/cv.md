# Education

* B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2014
* Ph.D in Materials Science and Engineering, 2020 (expected)

# Work experience

### Massachusetts Institute of Technology

##### Graduate Research Assistant (2014-present)

*Led independent materials science and engineering research on transiently cross-linked hydrogels. Discovered how metal ion cross- linked hydrogels can bypass traditional stoichiometric assembly limits through competition. Designed and engineered an environmentally stable, broad spectrum, vibration damping hydrogel in collaboration with MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Wrote a computational model to predict hydrogel mechanical properties as a function of material composition in MATLAB. Performed laboratory techniques to support this research, such as the synthesis, purification and characterization of various metal-coordinating polymers and ligands using NMR, LC/MS and MALDI, plus the characterization of the resulting hydrogels using rheology, UV-VIS, DSC, and Raman. Displayed leadership in the lab by training new users, and performing maintenance, on lab equipment such as our UV-VIS spectrometer, lyophilizer, rotary evaporator, vacuum pumps, pH probes, and water filtration system. Presented research at multiple national (APS, ACS, and MRS) and international conferences (in Germany and Switzerland). Research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

##### Environmental Health and Safety Laboratory Coordinator (2017-present)

*Coordinated laboratory safety by performing weekly inspections of our lab spaces and facilitating bi-annual inspections of the labs by MIT Environmental Health and Safety. Gave presentations to lab group on safety and waste management, and performed initial safety walkthrough and training with new lab users. Assisted in Massachusetts Water Resources Authority’s inspection of MIT. Ran lab’s glove recycling program and maintained chemical inventory.

### Air Force Research Laboratory

##### Materials Engineering Researcher (Summer 2013)

*Designed and performed experiments in the fields of liquid crystals, photochemistry, and optics. Characterized the novel phototropic liquid crystal state, which is an ordered phase induced by light. Examined how temperature, light intensity, and dye chemistry controls resulting phase boundary. Research published in Physical Review E.

##### Materials Engineering Researcher (Summer 2012)

*Explored the thermal tuning properties of nematic liquid crystal swelled polymer networks. Created thermal tunable optical filters by the creation of a helical polymer network using photo-polymerization in the presence of a self-assembled chiral liquid crystal solvent. Examined the optical filter’s response as a function of temperature. Research published in Journal of Materials Chemistry C.

##### Materials Engineering Researcher (Summer 2011)

*Designed and ran experiments testing the properties of photo-sensitive polymer stabilized chiral nematic liquid crystal systems. Examined the role of both crosslinking and monomer chemistry on optical filter wavelength tuning and relaxation. Published in Liquid Crystals and Journal of Materials Chemistry.

##### Materials Engineering Researcher (Summer 2010)

*Designed and performed experiments testing the tunability of optical filters formed by chiral nematic liquid crystals containing different classes of photo-sensitive chiral dopants. Recorded the first observation of light induced helical twist inversion in an aligned liquid crystal cell, which allows for the optical filter to dynamically flip filtering polarization. Research published in Advanced Materials.

### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

##### Undergraduate Materials Engineering Researcher (2012-2014)

*Performed research on nano-structured micro-batteries. Examined different lithium and manganese based electroplating conditions to develop a micro-battery with high energy density. Worked to develop polymer electrolyte for use with nano-structured battery. Examined the mechanical properties of high surface area, nickel inverse opal scaffold.
