excerpt: 'This work presents a detailed optical examination of the widely phototunable response of a cholesteric liquid crystal based on a photoinvertible chiral dopant. The resulting optical response is correlated to the mesomorphic behavior of the system during UV exposure. The original 1000-nm right handed reflection red-shifts throughout the optical range before inversion into a left handed cholesteric liquid crystal helix that blue-shifts to 1400 nm. Conceivably, this type of photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal could be used as a broadly tunable optical device. However, the unique capability of photoinversion allows for added applicability, for example as a photonic polarization switch.'

This work presents a detailed optical examination of the widely phototunable response of a cholesteric liquid crystal based on a photoinvertible chiral dopant. The resulting optical response is correlated to the mesomorphic behavior of the system during UV exposure. The original 1000-nm right handed reflection red-shifts throughout the optical range before inversion into a left handed cholesteric liquid crystal helix that blue-shifts to 1400 nm. Conceivably, this type of photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal could be used as a broadly tunable optical device. However, the unique capability of photoinversion allows for added applicability, for example as a photonic polarization switch.
