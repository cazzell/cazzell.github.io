2011-02-04	"Widely Tunable, Photoinvertible Cholesteric Liquid Crystals"	Advanced Materials	"This work presents a detailed optical examination of the widely phototunable response of a cholesteric liquid crystal based on a photoinvertible chiral dopant. The resulting optical response is correlated to the mesomorphic behavior of the system during UV exposure. The original 1000-nm right handed reflection red-shifts throughout the optical range before inversion into a left handed cholesteric liquid crystal helix that blue-shifts to 1400 nm. Conceivably, this type of photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal could be used as a broadly tunable optical device. However, the unique capability of photoinversion allows for added applicability, for example as a photonic polarization switch."	"White, T. J.; Cazzell, S. A.; Freer, A.

2012-02-13	Optically Reconfigurable Color Change in Chiral Nematic Liquid Crystals Based on Indolylfulgide Chiral Dopants.	Journal of Materials Chemistry	"Stimuli-directed changes in the coloration of chiral nematic liquid crystal devices are in nearly all cases color-restoring upon removal of the input stimulus. This work employs photoresponsive indolylfulgide chiral dopants to generate optically reconfigurable but color-stable reflectivity when formulated with a nematic liquid crystal host to form a chiral nematic mesophase. The optically-directed color change of the chiral nematic material system to UV and blue irradiation is examined as a function of concentration and light intensity. The temporal stability of the reflection notch at arbitrary spectral positions is presented – confirming that long-lasting, optically reconfigurable color changes are obtainable in this material system. The optically reconfigurable color-stable changes in reflection color could be useful as optical filters, smart textiles, or active camouflage."	"White, T. J.; Zhao, A. D.; Cazzell, S.

2012-08-31	"The Role of Crosslinking and Polarity in the Dark Relaxation of Azobenzene-Based, Polymer-Stabilised Cholesteric Liquid Crystals. "	Liquid Crystals	"Prior examinations have reported that polymer stabilisation of azobenzene-based cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) mixtures can reduce the time necessary for complete colour restoration in the dark from three days to as few as five minutes. This work extends upon these prior examinations by exploring and elucidating the role of crosslinker concentration and monomer polarity on the colour restoration of a representative CLC mixture composed of a high HTP bis(azo) binapthanyl chiral dopant (QL76) mixed into the cyanobiphenyl nematic liquid crystal host MDA-00-1444. The impact of these variables was unexpectedly convoluted. In all the formulations examined here, polymer stabilisation dramatically reduces the time for complete colour restoration of the starting reflection notch. In mixtures based on nonpolar liquid crystal monomers, increasing the crosslinker concentration reduces the time necessary for complete colour restoration. However, the dependence on crosslinker concentration reverses in mixtures composed from polar liquid crystal monomers in which increasing the crosslinker concentration serves to increase the time necessary for complete colour restoration."

2013-11-06	The Contribution of Chirality and Crosslinker Concentration to Reflection Wavelength Tuning in Structurally Chiral Nematic Gels.	Journal of Materials Chemistry C	"Tunable reflective material systems are potentially useful in a range of applications including displays, optical filters, photonics, and sensing. Presented here is a systematic study of thermally induced reflection wavelength tuning in structurally chiral nematic gels. The tuning is enabled by a swelling/de-swelling/re-swelling transition driven by order/disorder transitions in the liquid crystal and the liquid crystalline polymer network. By preparing liquid crystal polymer networks from single component liquid crystal monomers we isolate the contribution of chemical chirality and the crosslink density of the liquid crystal polymer network to thermally-induced reflection wavelength tuning. Further elucidating the fundamental relationships between the composition of the polymer network and the resulting optical properties is a key step towards enabling advancement and optimization necessary to realize the utility of this mechanism in devices such as mirrorless lasers."

2016-03-06	Quantification of Photoinduced Order Increase in Liquid Crystals with Naphthopyran Guests. 	Physical Review E	"Photoinduced order-increasing phase transitions can occur in dye-liquid crystal mixtures when the photoproduct of the excitation of the dye molecules is more compatible with the liquid crystalline medium than the initial dye species. A detailed investigation of the photoinduced changes of the phase behavior and optical properties of mixtures of liquid crystals with naphthopyran guests upon exposure to light at 365 nm is presented here. In these guest-host systems, the nematic-to-isotropic phase transition temperature is increased upon irradiation. We show that the nematic range can be extended up to 2.9 degrees Celsius by illumination in 5CB liquid crystal mixtures. The order parameter is significantly increased by illumination at all temperatures within the nematic range and the changes are larger at higher concentrations of the guests. In particular, the illuminated guest-host mixtures exhibit order parameters close to those of the neat liquid crystal host at the same temperature relative to the clearing point. An improved understanding of the photophysical processes taking place at the molecular level in these material systems can inform the design of photoresponsive materials and enhance their potential utility in optical or photonic devices"	"Rumi, M.; Cazzell, S.

2019-10-22	Expanding the stoichiometric window for metal cross-linked gel assembly using competition	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	"This paper reports how metal-coordination cross-linking can bypass traditional stoichiometric limits for macromolecular material assembly. Specifically, we use metal-coordinated hydrogels to demonstrate how to prevent excess cross-linker from dissolving macromolecular networks by using hydroxide ion competition to buffer excess metal ions and thereby protect the network. Additionally we use simulations to develop a thermodynamic framework that predicts the coupled dynamic equilibria conditions that result in this competition-induced network protection effect. This is a critical innovation, not only because it demonstrates how to overcome classical limits on macromolecular material cross-link stoichiometry, but also because it reveals an intrinsic robustness in the self-assembly of metal-coordinate networks, shedding additional light on the emerging prevalence of metal coordination in biological materials."
